minor_changes:
  - fixed bug where 'replace' would delete an active disable and not reinstate it
  - make l3_interfaces pick up loopback interfaces
  - added tests for verifying both of these
  - fixed over-zealous handling of disable, which could catch other interface
    items that are disabled.
  - enable support for 1.4 firewall
  - support for 1.4 ospf
