minor_changes:
  - deprecating items for 1.4+ that have moved locations
  - For 1.4, `protocol` is an attribute of the syslog host, not the facility
  - Fixed v1.3 and before when `protocol` and `level` were set for the same host

breaking_changes:
  - none yet

known_issues:
  - existing code for 1.3 facility protocol and facility level are not compatible,
    only one will be set and level is the priority.
