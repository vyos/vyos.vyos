breaking_changes:
  - vyos_logging_global - For 1.4, `protocol` is an attribute of the syslog host, not the facility

bugfixes:
  - vyos_logging_global - Fixed v1.3 and before when `protocol` and `level` were set for the same host

deprecated_features:
  - vyos_logging_global - `protocol` is deprecated for 1.4 and later, use `facility` instead. To be removed
    in next major version where supprot for 1.3 is removed

known_issues:
  - existing code for 1.3 facility protocol and facility level are not compatible,
    only one will be set and level is the priority.

trivial:
  - vyos_logging_global - Fixed integration test for `vyos_facts` which was brittle due to line dependencies in checks
  - vyos_logging_global - Fixed integration test for `vyos_config` due to bad commands. 1.3 frequently won't finish due
    to timeouts or system failures during the tests, but 1.4 and 1.5
